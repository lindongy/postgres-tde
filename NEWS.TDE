12.2_TDE_1.0beta2
=================

Bug fixes - TDE
---------------

* Fixed omission in page checksum computation.

Page checksum should not be computed for an empty page, however the emptiness
cannot be checked reliably after encryption. Doing so resulted in missed
update of the checksum in rare cases.


Bug fixes - PG core
-------------------

* All the fixes implemented in the 12.2 release, see
